I am an M.Sc. student in computer science at the University of British Columbia, and I am fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Margo Seltzer](https://www.seltzer.com/margo/). Previously, I completed my undergrad at Sharif University of Technology, where I majored in Computer Engineering and minored in Mathematics. My research interests lie generally in the areas of graph-structured data, network analysis, machine learning, and computational social science. >>>>

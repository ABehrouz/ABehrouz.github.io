<p align="justify">
I am an M.Sc. student in computer science at the University of British Columbia, and I am fortunate to be supervised by <a href="https://www.seltzer.com/margo/">Prof. Margo Seltzer</a>. Previously, I completed my B.Sc. at Sharif University of Technology, where I majored in Computer Engineering and minored in Mathematics. My research interests lie generally in the areas of graph-structured data, network analysis, machine learning, and computational social science.
